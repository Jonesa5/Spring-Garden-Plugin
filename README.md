# Sorceress' Spring Garden

The [Sorceress' Garden](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Sorceress%27s_Garden) 
is a minigame located in south-western Al Kharid 
useful for training thieving or collecting herbs.
This plugin helps show when it is safe to move to the next tile
by changing its color to green and red when it's not safe.

### Plugin Usage

Start by standing in the cyan colored tile just inside of the gate. 
When the next tile to move to turns green it means that you can click on it and move to it safely
When the next tile is red it means that it is not safe to move to and that you shoud wait.
After going through the maze a couple times with the plugin active you will get the hang of it 
and you will be able to antisipate when the next tile will turn green.

Here's an image showing when to click:

Although this may sound complicated,
after a couple runs you'll have the hang of it.

### Future plugin updates
Adding a number above the tiles to show when they are expected to turn green

Adding the same funcionality to the other gardens (Winter, Autumn, and Summer)

Adding a sound effect when it is safe to move to the next tile

Adding an overlay to show how many runs have been made/failed, how many fruits have been colected, 
    and how much experience you will get from the current amount of drinks in your inventory
